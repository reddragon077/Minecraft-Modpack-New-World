# New World project memory

Last synchronized: 2026-09-01

## Canonical workflow

- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/reddragon077/Minecraft-Modpack-New-World`
- GitHub `main` is the canonical shared source for development across computers.
- CurseForge instance directories are local runtime and test endpoints.
- Current registered machine: `laptop`; paths are stored in `machines/laptop.json`.
- The desktop machine must receive its own record when it is configured.

## Platform

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.235
- Third-party addons are pinned in `manifest.json` and audited in `pack-lock.json`.
- Only the two project-owned fork JARs are stored directly in Git: NewWorldCore and DoctorWhoMod.

## NewWorldCore continuation point

- Active synchronized test build: `NewWorldCore-1.21.1-NeoForge-0.5.58.0-alpha-expanded-geology-deposits.jar`.
- The verified `0.5.57.0` baseline is backed up under the laptop instance's `backups/custom-mods/known-good-0.5.57.0/` directory.
- The complete historical source tree is still missing. The reproducible expanded-geology delta is stored under `src-patches/newworldcore/` and built with `tools/build-newworldcore-geology-patch.ps1`.
- `0.5.56.0-alpha-radar-navigation-mining-recovery` was previously described as a known-good recovery baseline.
- Verify binaries and local source before selecting a development baseline; old chat labels are context, not proof.
- Preserve physical geology world generation, radar coordinates, deposit persistence, and navigation `DEPOSITS` integration.

## Geology resource rules

- One deposit family per real resource, not one duplicate per mod.
- Current `0.5.58.0` definitions: vanilla families plus Osmium, Tin, Lead, Uranium, Fluorite, Aluminum, Nickel, Silver, Zinc, Platinum, Uraninite, and Certus Quartz.
- Immersive Engineering supplies Aluminum and Silver; Nickel is shared with Oritech, while Lead and Uranium reuse their existing families.
- Create supplies Zinc; Oritech supplies Platinum; Powah Uraninite remains separate from Uranium.
- Applied Energistics 2 uses normal Certus Quartz only; Charged Certus is explicitly excluded.
- Lead is shared by Mekanism and Immersive Engineering.
- Nickel is shared by Immersive Engineering and Oritech.
- Uranium is shared where mods represent the same resource.
- The 0.5.58.0 JAR passed compile, archive, definition/template, SHA-256, and installed-registry validation. In-game acceptance testing is still required.

## Ship and progression decisions

- The ship is a permanent mobile research base and central progression space.
- The three-level main hull and room placement were considered complete.
- Standard modular concepts: five-block corridors, 3x4 bulkhead openings, and typical seven-block floor modules.
- Building Gadgets 2 and WorldEdit are development tools.
- Retained roadmap themes: research, production chambers, Android companion/UI, warp core, teleport network, nano suit, story quests, and first playable alpha.
- Radar/navigation, replication, geology, and TARDIS systems should remain one coherent progression loop.

## Safety and maintenance

- Inspect first, then change.
- Preserve known-good custom builds before replacement.
- Never load multiple NewWorldCore or DoctorWhoMod versions in one instance.
- Do not commit worlds, saves, backups, logs, crash reports, user caches, accounts, launcher metadata, or personal options.
- After substantial verified work, update this memory and `pack-lock.json`, then commit and push.
