# New World project memory

Last synchronized: 2026-09-01

## Canonical workflow

- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/reddragon077/Minecraft-Modpack-New-World`
- GitHub `main` is the canonical shared source for development across computers.
- CurseForge instance directories are local runtime and test endpoints.
- Registered machines: `laptop` and `desktop`; paths are stored under `machines/`.
- Desktop repository root: `E:\projects\Minecraft-Modpack-New-World`.
- Desktop CurseForge instance: `C:\Users\suley\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\New World`.

## Platform

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.235
- Third-party addons are pinned in `manifest.json` and audited in `pack-lock.json`.
- Only the two project-owned fork JARs are stored directly in Git: NewWorldCore and DoctorWhoMod.

## NewWorldCore continuation point

- Active synchronized test build: `NewWorldCore-1.21.1-NeoForge-0.5.59.4-alpha-full-placement-radar.jar` (SHA-256 `2530037eb38b25670a5d3d8019a04d7fc87e6ac106dc31b1a0ce90cecccee6de`). It is installed and running on the desktop instance; the laptop installation state remains to be verified.
- Desktop acceptance evidence now shows `Discoveries 101`, `Visited 6`, more than four reachable result rows, and modded result classes including Explorify, Better Dungeons, and Structory. The old four-record display limitation and dynamic modded-candidate retention are verified fixed for this run, but shared placement sets are incorrectly labelled `MODDED STRUCTURE` as if that were a real destination.
- The verified `0.5.57.0` baseline is backed up under the laptop instance's `backups/custom-mods/known-good-0.5.57.0/` directory.
- The complete historical source tree is still missing. The reproducible compatibility delta is stored under `src-patches/newworldcore/` and built with `tools/build-newworldcore-geology-patch.ps1`.
- `0.5.56.0-alpha-radar-navigation-mining-recovery` was previously described as a known-good recovery baseline.
- Verify binaries and local source before selecting a development baseline; old chat labels are context, not proof.
- Preserve physical geology world generation, radar coordinates, deposit persistence, and navigation `DEPOSITS` integration.

## Geology resource rules

- One deposit family per real resource, not one duplicate per mod.
- Current `0.5.59.4` definitions: vanilla families plus Osmium, Tin, Lead, Uranium, Fluorite, Aluminum, Nickel, Silver, Zinc, Platinum, Uraninite, and Certus Quartz.
- Immersive Engineering supplies Aluminum and Silver; Nickel is shared with Oritech, while Lead and Uranium reuse their existing families.
- Create supplies Zinc; Oritech supplies Platinum; Powah Uraninite remains separate from Uranium.
- Applied Energistics 2 uses normal Certus Quartz only; Charged Certus is explicitly excluded.
- Lead is shared by Mekanism and Immersive Engineering.
- Nickel is shared by Immersive Engineering and Oritech.
- Uranium is shared where mods represent the same resource.
- The 0.5.59.4 JAR passed compile, archive, binary entry-point, definition/template, SHA-256, desktop launch/world-load, result-list, and modded-candidate acceptance. Full scan completion/performance, Field Survey confirmation, geology isolation, and broader regression remain open.
- Structure Radar evolution: `0.5.59.0` namespace batches caused 40+ second ticks; `0.5.59.1` exact locate calls still caused 2–8 second spikes; `0.5.59.2` stalled at 128 results; `0.5.59.3` completed but its legacy fixed-label finish filter removed modded families and its vanilla locate tiles caused 8–13 second spikes. `0.5.59.4` uses placement math for both vanilla and modded structures, preserves dynamic family labels, completes every task, and retains the nearest 128 results. Placement candidates may be false positives until Field Survey confirms a generated structure.
- Confirmed `0.5.59.4` label defect: a placement shared by multiple structure families falls back to `MODDED STRUCTURE` in `Navigation0581DynamicStructureScanner.PlacementTask.family()`. That is not a registry structure or a discoverable place. Multi-family candidates must remain `UNKNOWN STRUCTURE` (or otherwise explicitly possible/unconfirmed) until Field Survey identifies an actual generated structure.
- Player Structure Field Survey now reads actual nearby structure starts and records only `STRUCTURE` discoveries; it must not reuse or mutate `GEOLOGY` discoveries.
- FE Matrix registration now deterministically selects Architectury's `register(ResourceLocation, Supplier)` overload, removing the nondeterministic startup `argument type mismatch` path.
- The Uraninite path passed an initial in-game acceptance test: Geological Radar -> Discovery -> Navigation target -> TARDIS route -> matching physical deposit. Full family, Mining and balance regression remains open.
- `docs/12_Gelistirme_Yol_Haritasi.md` is the active implementation order. Finish its Radar/Discovery/Player Interface/Deposit stages before Research and Production Chamber progression.

## Ship and progression decisions

- The ship is a permanent mobile research base and central progression space.
- The three-level main hull and room placement were considered complete.
- Standard modular concepts: five-block corridors, 3x4 bulkhead openings, and typical seven-block floor modules.
- Building Gadgets 2 and WorldEdit are development tools.
- Retained roadmap themes: research, production chambers, Android companion/UI, warp core, teleport network, nano suit, story quests, and first playable alpha.
- Radar/navigation, replication, geology, and TARDIS systems should remain one coherent progression loop.

## Safety and maintenance

- Inspect first, then change.
- Preserve known-good custom builds before replacement.
- Never load multiple NewWorldCore or DoctorWhoMod versions in one instance.
- Do not commit worlds, saves, backups, logs, crash reports, user caches, accounts, launcher metadata, or personal options.
- After substantial verified work, update this memory and `pack-lock.json`, then commit and push.
- Cross-computer conversation continuity lives in `.codex/HANDOFF.md` and `.codex/conversations/`. Read them after every pull and update them before switching computers.
